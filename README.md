# feathers-next.js
Feathers / Next.js Boilerplate

Status: Beta

Experiment to integrate Next.js with Feathers. Feathers example chat app has been ported to run on Next.js, with many improvements soon to come.

Areas where help would be appreciated:
- Split Login and Chat components into separate pages to utilize automatic code splitting in Next.js
- Set up server-side auth so chat page can be server-rendered
